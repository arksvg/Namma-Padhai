Introducing NammaPadhai – our award-winning comprehensive AI-driven solution designed to enhance road safety through four key modules:

🥱Fatigue Management System: An AI-powered face detection system that monitors fatigue, yawning, smoking, and seatbelt violations in drivers of cars, buses, and heavy motor vehicles. By detecting the signs of fatigue and distraction, our system helps prevent potential road mishaps. It triggers alert sounds based on detected behaviors to help prevent accidents.

👮‍♂️Traffic Personnel Training & AI Simulation Assessment: A virtual training and evaluation platform that uses AI-driven simulations to assess traffic personnel’s ability to recognize and respond to traffic signs, awarding performance-based scores and certificates. The goal is to ensure that traffic enforcers are well-trained, leading to safer roads.

🤖AI Chatbot Assistance: A knowledge-based chatbot that provides real-time assistance to users by responding to their road safety queries, thereby bridging the AI-driven support gap across 16 state-run transportation websites.

📑General Resources Page: A dedicated section that serves as a comprehensive knowledge hub, providing access to the latest road safety blogs, YouTube videos, Motor Vehicle Act PDFs, and other external resources, aimed at educating the public on road safety regulations and best practices to enhance awareness.

The technology stack used in NammaPadhai include ReactJS for the Frontend and Django (Python) for its backend, Zero-shot image classification using Hugging Face OpenAI model, Google’s MediaPipe, OpenAI API inference, No Code platform based Chatbot (Knowledge Base).
